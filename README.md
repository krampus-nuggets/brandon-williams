## Overview üåé

This repository is the home of my new portfolio site. If you're interested you can find my old one [here](https://krampus-nuggets.github.io)

1. Built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) which is based on [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)
2. [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) is used for querying data/content from Markdown and YAML files for ease-of-use.
3. [Snyk](https://snyk.io) is used for monitoring for security issues and patching vulnerabilities.
4. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is both the CI/CD and Hosting provider for the site.
5. [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) is used as a CDN because keeping binary files in a repository is a bad practice that can lead to bloated and heavy repositories.

## Design & Performance

The focus point of this project was to convey my overall self and skills to the viewer in the most performant way possible with access to this open-source project and a means to contact me. Details below:

## Work-In-Progress üöß

In retrospect there are still multiple aspects of this project that can still be optimized. The main goal was to complete the project as soon as possible in a passable state. Optimizations/Improvements will be applied after launch. Project to-do list below:

1. Convert static components to handle data more dynamically. ‚ùå
2. Convert all content files from Markdown to YAML. Markdown does not support data structures such as arrays and objects which became very inefficient as the project progressed ‚ùå
