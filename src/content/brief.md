introLine: "Hi there, I'm Brandon Williams and welcome to my portfolio page"

paragraphOne: "As you'll soon see in my career overview below I've been blessed to be a part of many projects across my career and I've worked under many roles across that time span as well. The main part I'd like to convey is that my approach to my work is as a knowledge seeker. I love learning new technologies, languages, systems, etc. I want to understand the broader picture in order to more efficiently work on the task at hand and deliver an end result that I myself can be proud of."

paragraphTwo: "Outside of the working environment I enjoy learning about technologies and research fields that peak my interest such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Reverse Engineering, etc. Mostly however I prefer to disconnect and relax when I can either with friends and family or by creating art with Music Production or Digital Art."

endNote: "Thanks for visiting"
